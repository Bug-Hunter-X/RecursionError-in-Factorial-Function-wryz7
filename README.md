# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: infinite recursion due to improper base case handling. The `factorial` function is correctly implemented for non-negative integers but lacks proper handling for negative inputs, leading to a `RecursionError`. The solution shows how to add input validation to prevent this.
